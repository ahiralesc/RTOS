### Internal Hardware Communication (IHC): UART/UASRT

Communication between hardware components is done over a shared medium (bus). Access to the bus is coordinated through a communication protocol. There are m√∫ltiple hardware protocols i.e. I2C, UART, SPI, etc. See [list of network buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_buses).
