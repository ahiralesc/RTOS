This repository integrates both theoretical insights and technical proficiency to streamline the creation of multitasking and real-time embedded systems rooted in ARM architecture. It focuses on leveraging the capabilities of [ST](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) STM32 models such as [F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f767zi.html) and [F413ZHT6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f413zh.html). The development process harnesses the power of [STM32Cube](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/ecosystems/stm32-open-development-environment/stm32cube.html) and [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) as essential tools for generating foundational code templates. For seamless communication between the workstation and the ST development node, we employ Segger [J-link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) and [ST-Link/V2](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) serial communication interfaces. To transmit textual outputs to the host machine via serial communication (UART/USART), we utilize [Hercules](https://www.hw-group.com/software/hercules-setup-utility) and/or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/), ensuring efficient data exchange and monitoring.

In the realm of preemptive execution contexts, tackling challenges like concurrency, shared resource management, interrupt handling, task synchronization, and inter-task communication stands as pivotal. This repository serves as a rich resource, offering extensive examples that encapsulate many of these complex scenarios. Our focus on multitasking applications revolves around the adept utilization of [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/). The examples included in the repository address specific problems, e.g. How to manage different types of tasks? how to synchronize them? How to protect critical regions? how to instrument data using different kinds of sensors? amomg many other examples. 

We also include a section of projects which multiple collaborators have shared over the years. Each project is accompanied by a Readme.md or Readme.ipyn file. Such provide valuable insights into various design aspects including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, performance characteristics, among other clases of data.
