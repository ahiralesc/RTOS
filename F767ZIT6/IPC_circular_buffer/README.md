### Internal Hardware Communication (IHC): UART/UASRT

Communication between hardware components is done over a shared medium termed a bus. Access to the bus is coordinated through a communication protocol i. e. I2C, UART, SPI, etc. See [network buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_buses) for a list of hardware network protocols. In this tutorial, we will address UART/UASRT asynchronous communication.
