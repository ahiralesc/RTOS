# STM32-F767ZIT6 RTOS examples


## I. Task management (task_mgmt)

The aim of the task management projects is to highlight the impact of poor task management practices on operating system performance. These projects serve as illustrative examples, demonstrating how improper task management can lead to the degradation of system performance. By studying these mini projects, learners can gain insights into the importance of effective task management in maintaining optimal system efficiency and responsiveness. Mini-projects include:

|Sequence|Project| Description|
|:--:|:------|:------|
|I.1|[Persistent task](https://github.com/ahiralesc/RTOS/tree/main/F767ZIT6/Task_mgmt_persistent)|shows how to create a persistent task in RTOS|
|I.2|[Periodic task](https://github.com/ahiralesc/RTOS/tree/main/F767ZIT6/Task_mgmt_periodic)|shows how to create a periodic task in RTOS|
|I.3|(Task frequency  regulation)[https://github.com/ahiralesc/RTOS/tree/main/F767ZIT6/Task_mgmt_frequency_regulation]|shows how to regulate the task frequency of a periodic task|
