This repository combines theoretical and technical expertise to facilitate the development of multitasking and real-time embedded systems based on ARM architecture. Specifically, the [ST](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) STM32 models [F767ZI](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f767zi.html) and [F413ZHT6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f413zh.html) are utilized for this purpose. The toolchain employed for generating template code includes [STM32Cube](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/ecosystems/stm32-open-development-environment/stm32cube.html) and [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). In order to establish communication between the workstation and the development node (ST), we rely on Segger [J-link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) and [ST-Link/V2](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) serial communication. Additionally, [Hercules](https://www.hw-group.com/software/hercules-setup-utility) and/or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) are utilized to transmit text output to the host machine via serial communication (UART/USART). 

In a preemptive execution context, various challenges such as concurrency, shared resource access, interrupt handling, task synchronization, and task communication need to be addressed. This repository provides comprehensive examples that cover many of these scenarios. For multitasking applications, we use [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) and interrupt driven solutions. Note, the examples in the architecture folder (i.e. F767ZIT6) contain contain small projects whose purpose is educational. Many of these examples have been adapted from Jim Cooling's material on real-time operating systems and Richard Barry's book on FreeRTOS. Additionally, the repository includes a projects folder that showcases proof-of-concept projects submitted by collaborators from the site. We extend our sincere gratitude to all of them for their time and contributions to this repository.

Each project in this repository is accompanied by a detailed Readme.md or Readme.ipyn file. These files provide valuable insights into various design aspects of the application, including its performance characteristics and other functional or non-functional aspects. By referring to these Readme files, users can gain a deeper understanding of the project's design and implementation, enabling them to make informed decisions and leverage the application's features effectively.
